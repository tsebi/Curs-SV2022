            <h3>What is “Kumiko”</h3>
            <p>
                Kumiko is a traditional Japanese technique, made of many wooden bars crossed and laid to form various designs and expressions.
                No nails or metal pieces are used, and the wooden parts are put together by adjusting grooves and angles.
            </p>

        <h2>The Origins of Kumiko</h2>
            <p>
                The art of making kumiko panels began in the 8th century CE, during the Asuka period. This was a fascinating period in Japanese history which shortly followed the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, as well as the nation debuting the name Nihon (loosely meaning land of the rising sun).
                The Asuka period was a time of intense political shifts in Japan, but it was also a time when the arts began to blossom. New forms of artistry, many of them influenced by Chinese art and architecture, began to take hold and shape the future of Japanese tradition. Among these was kumiko, which became a vital aspect to Japanese interior design from this period onwards.
            </p>
        <h2>How are Kumiko Made?</h2>
            <p>
                Kumiko wood is predominantly chosen and sourced from Japanese cedar and cypress trees. The wood from cypress trees is also used in the construction of Buddhist temples. This wood is durable, long-lasting, and bright in colour.
                The construction of kumiko involves no nails, screws, or glue, only the slotting together of wood pieces in geometric shapes, held firmly together by equally dispersed amounts of pressure. Everything is done by hand, from the carving of each individual piece (of which there are hundreds) to the assembling of the finished panel.m. New forms of artistry, many of them influenced by Chinese art and architecture, began to take hold and shape the future of Japanese tradition. Among these was kumiko, which became a vital aspect to Japanese interior design from this period onwards.

            <p>
                In order for a kumiko panel to function, each piece must be accurate to within 0.1mm, and the symmetry between them is all but absolute. Kumiko panels come in a range of symmetrical geometric patterns, most of which are inspired by nature (usually leaves and flowers) and hold a specific meaning. The sakura (cherry blossom) pattern, for example, would be used to encourage and hope for a good harvest.
                Kumiko artisans can train for decades and most master kumiko craftsmen come from a long line of woodwork specialists. For example, Matsuo Tanaka, founder of the Tatematsu brand, hand crafts all of his products, has specialized in kumiko woodcrafts for over fifty-two years and can make over 250 patterns.
